  Bubble sort is pretty simple and easy to use.
  It will start at zero and run through the entire array only switching elements when the one your on is bigger than the one next to it. 
  This will find the largest element in the array and put it in the last spot. It does this for a while through a for loop.
  It then starts at 0 again and repeats only doing the for loop where it will compare values since the last element is already in the right spot. 
  once it gets back to the beginning the array is sorted and it stops.  
	Binary search is done by taking an ordered array and finding the middle. 
  It then checks if the middle value is correct and if it isn’t it will look to see if the needed value is bigger or smaller.
  If it is smaller it will get a new middle. For example, it could go 30 which than would be 15 and from there 8. If it’s bigger it would find a new middle such as 
  23. It will repeat this until it leads it to the desired value or runs out of options.
