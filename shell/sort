Shell sort is basically a variation of insertion sort but used for a greater distance. It starts by taking a fixed number the width of the elements itâ€™s comparing.
It will compare pairs of numbers and switches and if the higher index number is less than the lower index number, however, if not the numbers won't change place. 
It then goes to a new width or interval because it divides by 2 to the nearest integer.
This will repeat until the interval only has a length of 1, then it will loop and the array will be sorted.
