Search- This algorithm is made to locate a number by looking in a linear way. When it finds the number it will bring it back even if there is multiple of the same number 
it will just bring back what it located first.

Insertion- A basic algorithm is insertion which simply fills an array set by the user and
determines the array size. It then does a for loop equal to the array length. 
The integer will then be put into whatever index corresponds to the for loop's current cycle. 

Deletion- the user will put an interger and then it preforms a search of the array until its location is found. 
Deletion just replaces it with the number to the right of it until the end of the array is found.
